    :Title: Consistency text similarity on the example of the task of recognizing hallucinations of language models
    :Type: Research work

Abstract
========

This work explores the recognition of hallucinations of language models in the tasks of machine translation, paraphrasing and modeling definitions. Approaches to solving this problem are based on measures of semantic similarity between sentences. We compare different approaches to the solution, and also propose a new measure of proximity - consistency similarity
